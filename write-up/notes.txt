questions to be answered:

whats the condition for which the block diag construction of the sub P would 
also be a valid big P?
	is it possible to have P with the right arrow area being completely zero??? 
	(most likely not)



not always is there a solution to every single nsd lyap equations





known results

1. for the linear system, not only the union but also the convex hull of the 
level sets of the quad lyap fcn are valid invariant set (trivial result but...
there's a rather simple interpretation of the combined fcn for the convex hull)


2. for a purely block-diag system, it's possible to get purely structured lyap 
candidate too iff 
the original one is possible to get validated by an un-sturcured P

3. numerical ranks of a (not necessarily square) matrix is useful for approximte
sparse and structured general matrices

4. found out about the Gershgorin Circle Theorem, extension to block diag 
dominant case

5. can be thought of as nominal system plus Singular Perturbation Methods in Control: Analysis and Design
